## Design Decisions

- We used the white on black color contrast for to-do items to signify importance.
- We used the white on green (less contrast than uncompleted item) to signify the decrease in importance (urgency).
- We decided to put all the options (such as hiding/ deleting items) into a toggle menu button to reduce clutter on the screen.
- We also put the options menu into the lower right corner. This makes it more easily accessible on a mobile screen (since it's closer to the fingers). Moreover, as we learned, the lower right corner is where the Z-pattern of the user's eye movement ends. By having the menu button in this location, it doesn't get in the way of the user's normal usage of the todo app, but can easily be found when the user needs it.
- We decided to have all the todo-items the same width so that the interface is cleaner and more pleasant (consistent) to look at. In other words, the user's eyes are not forced to move around too much looking for the beginning of the next todo item.
- Ideally we would have a checkmark icon and a trash icon next to the corresponding option menu items so that it's more intuitive to look at, and the user doesn't have to interpret the words. Due to time constraints, this is not implemented in this version of the design.
